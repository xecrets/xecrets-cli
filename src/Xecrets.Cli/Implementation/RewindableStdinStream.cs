/// A memory buffering re-openable wrapper around standard input. Since there is only one standard input
/// this may be registered as a singleton and instantiated that way. Except for the rewind buffer,
/// it's still forward only. It cannot be rewound back past a checkpoint. On the other hand if a new
/// instance is instantiated, that also works as way of making a checkpoint.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It has a limit to the amount it will buffer in memory, if it is exceeded an exception
/// will be thrown. If this becomes an issue, it should be extended to buffer to disk and
/// include code to definititely securely wipe what it writes to disk.
